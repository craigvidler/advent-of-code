Advent of Code
==============

My solutions (in Python) for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'll be gradually working through all past years (2015-2023) in rough order of difficulty rather than chronologically. So I'll start with the first five days from each year then complete another chunk in each year and so on, working towards the hardest problems (and no doubt skipping around and coming back if it makes sense to do so).
